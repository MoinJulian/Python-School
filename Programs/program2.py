###While Loops

# x = 1
# while x < 2: #Loop based on a condition
#     print(x)

#Condition is false and will run forever
# i = 1
# while i != 0:
#     print('This line runs forever')

# space = ' '
# i = 1
# while i != 0:
#     print('This line runs forever')
# end = space()

#While looop will iterrate until condition is true
# num = 1
# while num < 10:
#     print('This is turn', num)
#     num = num + 1
# print("This code is now finished")

#nested while loops
a = 0

while a < 4:

    while b < 4:
